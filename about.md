Hey, I am Harsha Kadekar. I am from **ಚಿಕ್ಕಮಗಳೂರು (Chikkamgaluru)**, **ಭಾರತ (India)**. Currently, I live in **Redmond (ರೆಡಮಂಡ್), USA (ಯು. ಎಸ್. ಎ)**.

I completed my B.E. in Computer Science & Engineering from JSSATE, Bengaluru. I had a great lecturer for Data Structures and Algorithms. My entry into the engineering field happened during my internship at RedForceLabs, Bengaluru. This was a computer security startup. I worked with my close friends during the internship to develop an application using windows API hooking method to be used as a target test application for the company. It was our first time coming up with a high level & low level design, clarifying the requirement with the stakeholder, coding for the product, debugging the issues, and testing. We had a great mentor from whom we learnt a lot. Our mentor was the CTO/Co-founder/CEO of the company.

Next hop was to Honeywell Technology Solutions Pvt. Ltd. I interned at Honeywell, Madurai.  During internship at Honeywell, I learnt a lot on many concepts - both computer as well as software engineer related. The internship itself felt like a formal 6 months crash course on Computer Software Engineering. Finally, got converted to full time engineer within Honeywell and got placed to a team in Bengaluru.

As an engineer at Honeywell, I have mixed feelings. I did grow in the team - reached Senior Engineer stage. But not sure of long lasting leanings to improve my overall skills as a software engineer. I did lot of coding using visual basic, C++, C# - dot net, Microsoft SQL. I also did got an opportunity to try distributed computing here. It feels like, I was more of doing hard work and impulsive coding. So, to summarise I was an immature engineer with lot of ego I guess to change my ways.

Then took a break from work. I went to do my Masters in Software Engineering at Arizona Sate University (ASU). I learnt lot of core concepts of Computer Science during my masters. Overall I had great lectures for Software Engineering, Software Architecture and Data Structures & Algorithms. The practical oriented teaching, open book exams and other ways of teaching was very refreshing. Most of the projects I did during this time were in Python. I also did a thesis which was finally published in **2018 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)** - [Effects of Error Messages on Students’ Ability to Understand and Fix Programming Errors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8658629)

Once I completed my Masters, I landed in AWS - Amazon as Software Development Engineer here at Seattle, USA. My biggest learning curve on Software Engineering happened here. Whether it is learning about linux, Java, Distributed Programming, handling things in scale, CI - CD, handling projects independently, root causing an issue, dev-ops. The list goes on I guess.

The work experience & university experience has taught me many concepts - technical as well as soft skills related to software engineering. The next important source of knowledge is via books. I like to read books of varying topics. I like to take notes while reading the book, so you should [find multiple posts of book summaries](https://harsha-kadekar.github.io/book-summary-archive.html).  This not only helps in the immediate field of work but also helps to expand my intellect on various other topics as well. I do believe in learning via practice so I spend time in personal coding projects too ([github profile](https://github.com/harsha-kadekar)).
