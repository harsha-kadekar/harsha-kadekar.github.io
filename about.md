I started my software journey from RedForce Labs as an Intern. Next hop was at Honeywell Technology Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Then took a break and went to do my Masters in Software Engineering at ASU. Once I completed my Masters, I landed in AWS - Amazon as Software Development Engineer.

The work experience & university experience has taught me many concepts - technical as well as soft skills related to software engineering. The next important source of knowledge is via books. I like to read books of varying topics. This not only helps in the immediate field of work but also helps to expand my intellect on various other topics as well. I do believe in learning via practice so I spend time in personal coding projects too.
