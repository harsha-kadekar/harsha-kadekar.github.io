## Personal Projects Update
- I am learning *Rust Programming Language*. As of now, I am just following - [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/). The ultimate goal is to develop my website/blog's back-end in Rust language.
- I am working on improving my personal blog. This includes being regular in pushing more posts, changes to the overall structure of the blog. Ideally, I want to host my blog in my home old machine.
	- Last year, I purchased a domain to host my blog - [harsha-kadekar.blog](https://www.harsha-kadekar.blog). As of now, it is pointing to my existing github pages blog - [harsha-kadekar.github.io](https://harsha-kadekar.github.io) 

## Personal Update
- Its been a year now since I became a father. Seeing daughter grow and learn things is a learning in itself.
- I have started reading Valmiki Ramayana from Sanskrit source. I do not know Sanskrit yet but hoping to learn somewhat from this journey. I am using these websites -  [sanskritsahitya - ramayana](https://sanskritsahitya.org/ramayanam) ,  [valmikiramayana.net](https://www.valmikiramayan.net) . I am using [ChatSutra AI](https://chat.two.ai) tool to teach me with translations.
- I am also going through the Prof. B Mahadevans Bhavadgeeta lectures - [Lecture Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWjpkY4mU2RDGv2r6nom5IvVKOYye0RAB)
- I have become more regular in doing [Sandhyavandana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandhyavandanam) . Though only doing evenings on weekend. Plan is to extend to festivals as well.

## Work Update
- I continue to work for [Amazon - Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com) as a Senior Software Development Engineer.
	- The transition is happening from  *"coding is my life"* mental model to *"thinking about product and team as a whole"*. 
		- How do I deliver results?

		- How do I develop others to progress the team and product?
