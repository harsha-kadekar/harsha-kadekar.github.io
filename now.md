## General Update
- I am learning *Rust Programming Language*. As of now, I am just following - [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/). The ultimate goal is to develop my website/blog's back-end in Rust language.
- This year embarked on improving my personal blog. This includes being regular in pushing more posts, changes to the overall structure of the blog. Ideally, I want to host my blog in my home old machine by purchasing a domain. So, these are all some preparations for that.
- I have started reading Valmiki Ramayana from Sanskrit source. I do not know Sanskrit yet but hoping to learn somewhat from this journey. I am using these websites -  [sanskritsahitya - ramayana](https://sanskritsahitya.org/ramayanam) ,  [valmikiramayana.net](https://www.valmikiramayan.net) . I am using [ChatSutra AI](https://chat.two.ai) tool to teach me with translations.

## Personal Update
- Its been a year now, becoming a father. Seeing daughter grow and learn things is a learning in itself.

## Work Update
- I continue to work for [Amazon - Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com) as a Senior Software Development Engineer.
