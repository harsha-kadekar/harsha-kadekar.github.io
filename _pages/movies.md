In 2-3 hours time, you are asked to influence a large number of people from varying background with innumerable opinions. One of the most effective way is cinema. It may be documentary, tv/web series or movie. It evokes emotions – you cry yourself, you become empathetic, you enrage, you laugh at the end you become one with a character which is so alien to you just 2-3 hours before. You feel for that character, you think what I can do to a lifeless and imaginary character. – Well I guess by this time you might have figured out I love movies. Here is a list of special mentions –

## Kannada
