This blog is a place where I show off my skills, my learning and also write my opinions. Oh my name is as mentioned in the URL – its Harsha Kadekar. I am a software engineer. Once I completed my computer science engineering, I went ahead and joined a software company. I worked for 5 years, became a senior software engineer. Then finally decided, I need to start fresh and upgrade myself. So went back to drawing board as in went back to school and earned my Master’s in software engineering. Finally, became a software engineer again!!!
