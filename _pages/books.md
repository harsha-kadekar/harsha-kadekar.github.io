I read various kinds of books. It has taught me a lot and has been guiding me. One of the thing I observed was, after reading the book I forget most of its content or main idea within few days. Also if the book was big and I took long time to finish it, by the time I reached the end of the book, I would have forgotten what did I read in the beginning of the book. So it would be a good thought exercise for me to recap the book's content and write down the gist of it. So this page will hold the small gist or learnings I took away from reading that book.

All the books I read are bookmared in [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/harsha_kadekar)
