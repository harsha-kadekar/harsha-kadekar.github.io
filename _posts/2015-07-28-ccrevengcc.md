After my first internship at RedForce Labs, I was interested to learn assembly language. I tried to develop a `disassembler`. This is way back in 2011. The development of the `disassembler` did not complete. In those days, we 3 of us â€“ myself, Srivatsa and Shishir had created a google site for the development of this `disassembler`. In this google site, I had published all the learning exercises about assembly language and also initial attempts of development are posted there. It has very useful resources. Only, Shishir was successful in creating a `disassembler`.
