The book gives a bird eye view of how education was provided in India over different century. This is a quick read book. The author has come up with a next version of the book which goes in depth regarding these topics. This is definitely worth a gift to children and teens. Seeing our current education system, I often wondered how it was in the ancient times. I had heard the name of Nalanda and Takshashila universities but wondered how the education and knowledge was imparted. Till now, it felt that scientific rigour was developed by the western civilisation. We had scientific discoveries and scientific theories developed but because of the way it was presented in our text books, it felt like those are by chance inventions. This book completely removes such notions. We, Indians had elaborate network of institutions as well as a very structured way of imparting knowledge to the students. There are so many scripts dealing with varying disciplines. The facilities that were provided in the university was very much comparable to the current standards. At that time also, the students from around the world sought education from these universities. Also the students and teachers of these universities were sought after for the reputed positions in many kingdoms. There were other institutions which supported them like Mathas, Agraharas and Temples. This book also gives a sad picture of how this network got destroyed with the Islamic invasions and British colonisation. Even the Indian government after independence fails to support and help rebuild this network.

This Shloka from Taittriya Upanishad (Siksha Valli) gives the oath provided to a newly graduated student.

`वेदमनूत्व्याचार्योऽन्तेवासिनमनुशास्ति` - After teaching vedas to their shishyas, Guru instructs

`सत्यं वद।` - Always speak truth

`घर्मं चर।` - Always tread the path of Dharma (do your duty)

`स्वाध्यायान्‌ मा प्रमदः।` - Always indulge in self study and do not sit idle.

`आचार्याय प्रियं धनमाहृत्य प्रजातन्तुं मा व्यवच्छेत्सीः ।` - Provide the fee Guru desires

`सत्यान्न प्रमदितव्यम् ।` - Never stray away from truth

`धर्मान्न प्रमदितव्यम् ।` - Never stray away from Dharma (or your duty)

`कुशलान्न प्रमदितव्यम् ।` - Never overlook your own welfare and health

`भूत्यै न प्रमदितव्यम् ।` - Never overlook your own prosperity

`स्वाध्यायप्रवचनाभ्यां न प्रमदितव्यम् ॥ १॥` - Never neglect the self study and propagation of Veda (knowledge)

`देवपितृकार्याभ्यां न प्रमदितव्यम् ।` - Never stray away from the works of God and ancestors

`मातृदेवो भव ।` - Know your mother to be like a godess

`यान्यनवद्यानि कर्माणि । तानि सेवितव्यानि । नो इतराणि ।` - Only do those actions which are in accordance with the shastras and society. Do not perform actions that oppose this

```
यान्यस्माकꣳसुचरितानि । तानि त्वयोपास्यानि ।नो इतराणि ॥ २॥
ये के चास्मत्व्छ्रेयांसो ब्राह्मणाः। तेषां त्वयाऽऽसनेन प्रश्वसितव्यम्‌।
```

Moreover, only adopt our good conduct, nothing else. After leaving here, if you find a teacher better than us, then respect him, pay homage to him by offering him a seat

`एष आदेशः। एष उपदेशः। एतदनुशासनम्‌। एवमुपासितव्यम्‌।` - This is our final command. This is the teaching. Go forth, live according to this
