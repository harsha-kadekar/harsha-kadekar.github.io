## Summary:
- Put all your tasks at one place
- Prioritise the added task. To prioritise a task, 
	- decide if the tasks need is urgent or not.
	- Estimate the value of the task by estimating the impact of the task to the team/org/product/other teams
- Sort the tasks by the effort those task will take to finish.
- Be on time especially to the meetings or any commitments.
- Be present and focused when doing an task.
- Keep track of everything in one place.
- When you are thinking of a difficult task or project, change the way we think. Instead of thinking `we can't do this because of ...`, we should change the thinking like `we can do this if these things exist - ...`.
- When stone walled on a task and procrastinating the tasks, to break out of this do one thing which can be done in next 5 - 10 minutes. 
- For every task or milestone, set some deadline and then for these tasks establish timeline.
## My thoughts
- I use Obsidian to capture all the thoughts and tasks (you can see [My_Development_Configuration]({% post_url 2022-05-13-my-development-configuration %})).
- I need to learn to set priority for the tasks so that I can better plan and be more effective.
- I need to practice coming up with `we can do this if ... exists` mentality especially when designing.
- Many of the the above solutions sounds similar to what is prescribed in Get things done book (here is summary - [Book-Summary-Getting_Things_Done]({% post_url 2022-12-27-book-summary-getting-things-done %})). If you have not read the book, do read it.
