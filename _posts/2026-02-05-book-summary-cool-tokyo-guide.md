We have planned for Japan trip in few months. Anu got this book to understand about the places we are visiting and Tokyo city in general. This is a first time that I saw a tour guide in comic style. It was great. It gave so many useful information about the places, culture, language and people. It provided many useful sentences in Japanese that any non Japanese speaking tourist can use during the travel. It also explained cultural things that one needs to keep in mind. 

I so wish that we have similar books in India for different states/cities to better understand the people, the culture, the language and the places.
