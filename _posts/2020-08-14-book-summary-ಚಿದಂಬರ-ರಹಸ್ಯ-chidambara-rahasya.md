I really liked the approach in which the story began and how the author keeps the mystery through out the book,but sadly that mystery remains unanswered (may be that's why the title is called [Chidambara Rahasya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chidambara_Rahasiyam)). I was astounded how multiple topics are inter-weaved into a single story.The part where the intelligence officer is not able to proceed further and approaches his novelist friend to create a story based on the present known facts and then using this story to proceed further in his work was a unique way of approaching a problem. The book also describes very nicely how each individual sees the same incident in different views due to their preexisting biases. Each individual tries to gain something from the current circumstances and uses selfish acts to achieve it. These individual selfish acts may look small when seen in the individual level or compared to other such individual acts, but these selfish acts quickly add up to a big dent to the overall health of the society. These selfish acts will make other acts much easier because for the mind it gets more examples, thus helping to take the selfish side quicker and justify such deeds. The ending of the novel was very abrupt and leaves the reader with unanswered questions about the overall story or the meta physics/psychology.
