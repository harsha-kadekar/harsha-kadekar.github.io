The book is about corporate politics. The main protagonist is hunted (ಶಿಕಾರಿ Shikari) from multiple directions. The narration of the story is also very different, as in everything is happening through the view point of the hero. It's as if I am part of the mind of the hero and listening to every thought that is getting generated in his mind. It gives clear picture of how the game of corporate politics and it's fight are fought. How each human relation is utilised for achieving something in the corporate world, how a person becomes a pawn between the fights of heads. The thing which stood out is how it gives a clear picture of human greed and selfish nature. The moment when a person is in the path of losing, everyone will swoop in like vultures to take their revenge and also the moment humans come to know that you are a losing side, they will shift their allegiance. You and you alone are your friend. Its a good read.
