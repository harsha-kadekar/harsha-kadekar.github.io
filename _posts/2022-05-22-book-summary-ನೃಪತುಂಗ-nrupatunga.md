This is a book about [Rashtrakuta King Amoghavarsha Nrupatunga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoghavarsha). This is a novel based on historical facts. But author has taken his artistic freedom to change certain aspects of it. On reading the story of King Nrupatunga, I felt it is so important to have a very good teacher who imparts the right knowledge and helps in guiding the development of right attitude. Certain ideals of King are very unique with respect to India - Whether it may be respecting the public, treating people of the state as the utmost authority, subjecting family members to scrutiny as per the law of the land or if need be do not hesitate to go for a war even when you are a peace loving king. Even though it is not democracy and yet people of the kingdom is given the highest authority. I liked the conversations between King Nrupatunga, his son's Guru Gunabadra Acharya and Golayabhatta. They explain how Kings work, if done without any attachments will lead to Moksha. And yet some aspects of the novel was not good, as at one hand King needs to hold Dharma above his family and people but still ends up giving pardon to his son.
