This is a small book. In this Shatavadhani Ganesh talks about different characters of Shiva, Rama and Krishna. Then, goes on to show how - 
- Shiva shows the highest that can be achieved in our personal self  
- Rama shows the model for family life  
- Krishna shows the model for interacting with society

Without much of an expectation I took up this book to clear off my yearly book reading goal as this was a small book. Once I started could not put it down.  

Never knew we can interpret our Puranas to the current day to day life. There is so much details and examples mentioned in this book which were all eye opening to me.I also did not know so much details of Shiva, Rama or Krishna's life. Now I am inspired to read the actual versions of these Puranas. Each character's attitude and situations of the usage of those virtues gives a lasting impact of the Gods Shiva, Rama and Krishna. A must read for anyone curious to know how life of God can be an inspiration for daily human life.
