This is definitely a very different type of book. There is no story as such but consists of many small stories about different people of a village. This gives a good overview of village life. It does touch on few of the rigid activities or customs which existed and how those customs are changed by the younger generation. This also shows the simple go free life of a villager. There are things which shows the creativeness of the villagers, age and cultural gap between the young and old respecting the traditions. Overall its a good time-pass and one time read, but a person who is from village or spent some time in village will definitely feel nostalgic about their past while reading this book.
