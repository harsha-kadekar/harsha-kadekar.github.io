title: My Obsidian Setup
updated: 2025-06-27
---

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) tool for various things. As of now, I am using Obsidian as the primary task management tool. The other important purposes are bookmark links, reflection/thoughts capturing, general note taking tool. This also acts as my blog - as in all the blog notes are stored here and migrated to my static website later. I am trying to generalize the works I do in Obsidian, so it might not capture everything (check out appendix section which has the detailed list).

## Obsidian Plug-ins I use

Among the core plug-ins, I extensively use following
- Bases - I use to list all my projects, bookmarked links.
- Daily Notes - This is the current days planning, tracking and reflection note
- Backlinks - I use it to understand which other notes are referring this note which helps in keep the context close.
- Outline - Sometimes notes becomes big and this helps to jump around the note
- Files - browse all the files in the vault.
- Command Pallete - Access various commands and tools
- Template - Many of the templates I have uses the template keys.

Among the community plug-ins, I use following - 
- Tasks - To track all the tasks across projects and stand alone work
- Reminder - To remind me of the tasks for a week at the right time.
- Dataview - I use it for automating and templatizing many of the tasks.
- Templater - To create templates of various kinds
- Obsidian Git - Primary backup mechanism of my vault - to push things to private repo in regular interval
- Homepage - Single door to various other important links
- Excalidraw - Free hand drawing
- Calendar - To access notes across days, months and years
- Charts - To view the trends of the data I have collected
- Table of Contents - When writing blogs or documents, this helps to generate table of content for it.
- Tag Wrangler - Use it to rename or delete the tags everywhere.
- Advanced Table Management - Many of my data are in table format and this helps to work with tables in markdown
- Automatic List Management - Most of my tasks are in the form of long running check list. This helps to re-order the lists based on the checked entries
- PlantUML - Used for generating the sequence diagrams of the components. 

## Templates

As of now I have following templates
- DailyNote - This is for creating the daily notes. It has sections for planned tasks, reflections and daily rating
- WeekSummary - This is mainly used for reflections of the week. It would have references for the DailyNotes of that week, things I did that week, thoughts and rating for the week
- MonthNote - This is for planning for the month as well as the reflection of that month. It has references to Week summaries of that month. Then overall rating for that month.
- YearNote - This has plan for that year as well as reflections of that year. It would have references to each month of that year. 
- Project - This is used for tracking projects. It has section to list tasks of that project, links to notes of the project as well as links to resources 
- Task - This represent the individual task of a project.
- Note - This represent a general note.

## Theme
I keep changing my theme for Obsidian in regular interval. As of now, I am using `Minimal`. 

## Projects
There are some projects which has fixed start and end. Example projects are learning rust, Alaska tour for 2025, renewing car lease, etc.
There are some tasks that does not belong to any particular project rather they are one of tasks. They are put into following buckets - Health, Finance, Career, Small Ops and Blogs. 
Every Task and Note are linked to the these Projects.

## Bookmarks
I have setup an Obsidian Base to keep track of the bookmark links. I use Obsidian Web Clipper to bookmark the web link to my vault. 

## Blog
I keep all my blog posts and blog pages as Obsidian notes in a separate folder within my vault. It has a draft folder where future posts are written. Here is [my previous post](https://www.harsha-kadekar.blog/obsidiantogithubpages.html) which talks in depth of how I publish my Obsidian notes to Github Pages
