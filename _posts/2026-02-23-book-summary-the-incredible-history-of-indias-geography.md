As the name suggests, in this book we get a bird's eye view of how India's Geography shaped over the life time of Earth. The different cycles of development and destruction can be read. It is fascinating to see the continuity of things and yet have so much diversity, as if everything is culminating to bring out a picture which is still in progress. It feels proud about the earliest histories and their achievements - Sarswathi-Sindhu civilization, Mauryan empire, Guptas, Cholas, sea trades across various countries. And yet the pain it hits when the decline starts around 10th century - how things start to turn.  It also feels like so many opportunities missed to revive it - some hopes were Akbars rule, Vijayanagar Empire and then it again falls off. It is also interesting to see how the British and Europeans went about in understanding the sea as well Indian Land. They continuously learnt from their mistakes and kept improving. 

Definitely a nice read to give the overview of how India of today exists.
