	- Find the difference between risk and ruin. Example 
		- Jumping from a bench is risk - which may be good for bones and body to build strength. 
		- Jumping from a 22nd floor is ruin. - this will result in death
		- So, identify each case - financial, family, social situations - is it a risk or a ruin. Only take it if it is risk and not ruin. The only diference between highly successful vs successful person is that they say no to almost everything.

	- Because of the deadline usually members will cut corners to meet the deadline
	- Alternate is to have pre-emption points. These are regular intervals in which we review all the tasks. If some tasks are taking too much time, then either change the strategy, or drop it completely or re prioritize it. 
	- Then maintain a good task queuing system. We should always prioritize small high value tasks. We should not just do first in first out way of prioritising the tasks.
