- Summary - 
	- Time Probability - Example single person going to casino 100 times in 100 days. Here even a single day of failure or going burst will stop the workflow there only
	- Ensemble Probability - Example when 100 people go to a casino at the same time. Here one person going bust will not impact the overall result
	- Find the difference between risk and ruin. Example 
		- Jumping from a bench is risk - which may be good for bones and body to build strength. 
		- Jumping from a 22nd floor is ruin. - this will result in death
		- So, identify each case - financial, family, social situations - is it a risk or a ruin. Only take it if it is risk and not ruin. The only diference between highly successful vs successful person is that they say no to almost everything.
	- Courage and Prudence can exists at the same time.

		- Professional Diversity of opinion and ability to voice dissent  
		- Keeping the discussion of risk alive even after repeated success  
		- Deference to expertise that is those in the sharp end and not the blunt end   
		- Ability to say stop

- Summary:
	- Deadlines usually just add pressure to the team and members without adding any value
	- Even the Parkinson Law corroborate it. The work will expand until deadline.
	- There is no action to be taken - either we need to move the deadline or drop from features and ship half baked product.
	- Because of the deadline usually members will cut corners to meet the deadline
	- Alternate is to have pre-emption points. These are regular intervals in which we review all the tasks. If some tasks are taking too much time, then either change the strategy, or drop it completely or re prioritize it. 
	- Then maintain a good task queuing system. We should always prioritize small high value tasks. We should not just do first in first out way of prioritising the tasks.

- Summary:
	-  Can create first responders rotation to review the code reviews/pull requests. Rotation can be daily
	- Develop a standard within the team of how code should be reviewed and how CR should be raised
		- If possible use automation to implement these standards
	- As a reviewer - communication should be clearer
		- differentiate between personal preference and blockers
		- Provide examples or suggestions do not just say this needs to be changed example variable names or alternate way to implement this
	- Reiterate your understanding of the change being done before approving or rejecting the code. That helps to surface any miss-understanding
	- Always remember, the author of the code review has the most context of the change. You should be asking questions to understand what is being written.
	- Its good to comment on things you liked, or you agreed on and explain why you agree this is the right way to do.
	- Do not withheld a review just for personal preference changes. Rather ask them to follow up with a new CR.

- Summary
	- When you hear something in jargon then un-jargon them.   
	- Jargon masks partial understanding. You should be able to explain stuff in simple terms  
	- Do not think about the source of knowledge. Just because it came from a very respected person or a thought leader, do not take that in as truth. Objectively and logically think if that is truth, that is applicable to you and if it makes sense logically.  
	- To improve critical thinking 
		- Un jargon what you heard.  
		- Do the research and validate the info  
		- Ask why and how. Do not move ahead until you understand and why and how aspect.   
	- Without critical thinking, you will let others think for you and also do not spot the issues in the arguments  
	- Anything you do not understand, then question it. Put effort to understand it .

- Date Read: 2024-12-01
- Link: [On being a Senior Engineer](https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/)
- Summary:
	- You don't wake up one day and become a senior engineer.   
	- Senior engineers do not know everything  
	- There is no check list to say that yes we can cross off these entries hence he/she is a senior engineer.  
	- They are not perfect with their technical knowledge and they are okay with that.  
	- Senior engineer should be a mature engineer   
	- Some level of mastery is needed in technical fields like algorithms, networking, debugging, etc  
	- What are the personal characteristics that can influence the team and organization in a positive way  
	- Mature engineers seek out constructive criticism of their designs 
	- Is this sound right?  
	- What I am missing here?  
	- Where will this go wrong?  
	- Is this explained in a way others can understand?  
	- Beg for bad news in the design phase 
	- Code doesn't have feelings. Critique the code and the design. Point out what might fail in code/design. But do not critique the engineer or character of the engineer.  
	- You should be the engineer who others want to work with. Do not be an asshole.  
	- Mature engineers should be comfortable with working with some uncertainty and risk.  
	- They should be able to provide estimates and constantly work on improving those estimates  
	- Mature engineers have anticipations like  
		- Does this code look good  
		- Does others will be able to understand it  
		- How effectively this is going to execute in production   
		- Etc  
	- Getting things done - whether it's a super fun project and bored to death work - they give their best. It has to be done  
	- Be a force multiplier. You cannot do all the work. You need to involve others and make sure they learn what to do, how to do and why they need to do.Dont be that super hero who just parachutes into that place asks others to move aside do the work and fly out from there. That's not cool. Have patience, teach them, work with them, involve them in the work you are doing.  
	- Be a sponsor to your junior engineers so that they get enough platform to showcase their excellent skills.  
	- Every decision whether it is design choices or coding choices or anything process has tradeoffs. Be upfront of what are the tradeoffs. What is ideal and what is not so ideal about this decision or design. So that we know what breaks and take necessary mitigation or know when this needs to be re written.   
	- Everyone is aiming for optimization of cost, be upfront about it  
	- Don't do " cover your ass engineer" - "hey everything I did was right but they did it all wrong, so everything broke so I am not responsible"  
	- As a leader it is your responsibility. To fix inherent issues in product and team  
	- Be empathetic towards all the stakeholders of the project. There will be conflicting goals and requirements as each has different perspectives. Work the requirements instead of just complaining about difference   
	- Do not just bring empty complaints. Come with data why it needs to be changed and important come with at least one solution of how to solve that.  
	- Remove the fear in the product for the team  
	- Fight or aware of these biases 
	- Self serving biases - if something is good that's mine, if something is bad or broken then it is done by others  
	- Fundamental attribution - of some did wrong or broke something it's because of the personality of that person. If I did something bad, it is because of the situation I was in rather others made me to do it  
	- Hindsight biased - In the hindsight we should have seen this or they should have seen it, how did they not think about it or I knew it all along  
	- Outcome biases - judgement of the decision or product is proportional to the severity of the event.   
	- Planning fallacy - being optimistic about the time and outcome in the future  
	- Understand that you will make mistake in code or design - so it is about how early you can catch them before it goes to production   
	- You are not your code. Point of review is to find errors or problems. It will be found so do not take it personally   
	- Seek and accept inputs from others especially when you think you do not need. No matter how much you know about a subject there is some knowledge out there which is present with someone else. So seek it.  
	- Do not rewrite code without consultation or rather if you think someone has written a code which you think could have written better, work with that engineer discuss and improve it with him in the code review.  
	- Treat everyone with respect, especially the ones with non technical and less knowledgeable people  
	- Every thing will change accept it and work for that change. Do not treat a change as inconvenience rather if you think that change is inconvenience find out why and make that change better  
	- Cultivate and seek knowledge. Knowledge earns respect. Position should not earn respect.   
	- Fight for your cause but gracefully accept defeat. Or disagree and committ. Do not be that person who says - I told you so  
	- Do not be the coder in the corner. Coder in the corner is out of touch out of sight and out of control  
	- Get involved in the conversations and get involved in the team and organization   
	- Critique code. Be nice to the person who wrote the code but not to the code. Be positive towards the changes recommended   
	- Remember that when you take a decision some people will be against it or do not like it.

	- This may initially look very slow and annoying but it will give good dividends later.  
	- For writing it may be internal communication to team, external public doc, comment, informal reviews or your own opinion.  
	- The moment you have a thought write it and keep going back to it to make it better.

- Summary: 
	- When you are buying anything look for cost per use value - How many times you  will use it and divide the price by that number.
	- Sometimes even though price of the thing will be high upfront but it will be durable and hence lasts longs. So its cost per use value is very less when compared to buying a low quality item with less price.
	- All items cannot be looked into cost per use, some have cost per thrill, cost per smile, cost per lesson, cost per externality.
	- Conditions for durability varies
		- what is the quality of this?
		- can it be dismantled and repaired?
		- does it have resale value?
		- does it have replacable parts?
		- can it perform multiple jobs?
	- Sometimes we will not know the exact number of usage. In such cases we have to estimate via the frequency of the usage.
